# StockPredictionModelCpp
# author : Omar Salah aka (Omar-hk)

This is a C++ Linear Regression Model that reads data from a CSV file and predicts the stock price for a given input value.

The code reads data from a CSV file named “houses.csv” and stores it in a 2D vector called “data”. The first column of the CSV file contains the input values (x) and the second column contains the output values (y).

The code then calculates the mean of x and y values using the “calculateMean” function. It then calculates the slope of the line of best fit using the “calculateSlope” function and the intercept using the “calculateIntercept” function.

Finally, it prompts the user to enter an input value (xValue) and uses the “predictStockPrice” function to predict the output value (yValue) for that input value.
